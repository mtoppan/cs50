# BlackJack Overview

This project was a collaborative final project for Dartmouth's COSC050: Software Design and Implementation course. We were tasked with designing and building a system to play BlackJack, featuring a Player that connects to a networked dealer and trains on it to determine the best action at each point in the game; a Network to connect to a course-provided remote dealer for live in-class testing; a custom test Dealer on which to train the Player; and a Card structure called within the Player. I was solely responsible for the Player module.
